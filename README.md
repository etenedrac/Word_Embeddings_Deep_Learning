# Word_Embeddings_Deep_Learning
Tensorflow core implementation of the Skip-gram and CBOW strategies to generate word embeddings.


# How to use
The data has been processed with the file ```Data_preprocessing.ipynb```

The algorithm for the Skip-gram can be found on ```word2vec_basic.py``` 

The algorithm for the CBOW can be found on ```word2vec_cbow_basic.py```
